R Codes for Introduction to R Programming lectures

Feel free to download, play with, and redistribute these files.

I would be very happy if people can learn R with the help of my code.

The video lectures (in mandarin) are available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTcf4SwWEI9_kCOJ-1o-Jwr-_Qb6bkeg

I know some of you might have difficulties in watching videos on Youtube, so that I posted the series of lecture onto Youku as well whose link is http://list.youku.com/albumlist/show/id_23660343.html?sf=10101&spm=0.0.0.0.wanA38

Contact me (minghaowu_2015@163.com) if there is any problem, but reply is not guaranteed.
