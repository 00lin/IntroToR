Lecture Code for Introduction to R Programming

Feel free to download, manipulate, and redistribute this code.

I would be very happy if people can learn R with the help of my code.

The video lectures (in mandarin) are available at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBTcf4SwWEI9_kCOJ-1o-Jwr-_Qb6bkeg

Contact me (minghaowu_2015@163.com) if there is any problem, but reply is not guaranteed.
